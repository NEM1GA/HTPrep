# Git 02.Git.local

## Initialize local repository on a test host. Create the following branches:
* master (init branch) *has 2 commits*
* dev (has been created from master) *has 2 commits from master + 2 additional*
* features/do_one (has been created from dev branch) *has 2 commits from master + 2 additional from dev + 1 additional*
* hotfix/we_gonna_die (has been created from master branch) *has 2 commits from master + 1 additional commit*

```bash
    1  mkdir 02.Git
    2  cd 02.Git
    3  git init
    4  git config user.name "Ilya Bombel"
    5  git config user.email "bombel.ilya@gmail.com"
    6  date > date.txt
    7  git add -A
    8  git commit -m "1st commit to master"
    9  whoami > currentuser.txt
   10  git add -A
   11  git commit -m "2nd commit to master"
   12  git checkout -b dev
   13  nano dev1.txt
   14  git add -A
   15  git commit -m "1st commit to Dev"
   16  nano dev2.txt
   17  git add -A
   18  git commit -m "2nd commit to Dev"
   19  git checkout -b features/do_one
   20  nano ftrs.txt
   21  git add -A
   22  git commit -m "1st commit to Features"
   23  git checkout master
   24  git checkout -b hotfix/we_gonna_die
   25  nano fix.txt
   26  git add -A
   27  git commit -m "1st commit to Hotfix"
   28  git checkout master
   29  git merge dev
   30  git merge features/do_one
   31  git log --oneline
   32  git cherry-pick 7de5cbf
   33  git log --oneline
   34  git checkout dev
   35  git cherry-pick 7de5cbf
   36  git log --oneline
   37  git checkout features/do_one
   38  git cherry-pick 7de5cbf
   39  git log --oneline
   40  history
```

## Play the following situations:
* Release phase - all commits should be inside master (except commits which is presented in branch hotfix)
```bash
a7bf9f2 (HEAD -> master, features/do_one) 1st commit to Features
7123dda (dev) 2nd commit to Dev
54a1302 1st commit to Dev
53aaf12 2nd commit to master
0f73a42 1st commit to master
```
* Hotfix deploy - commit from hotfix/we_gonna_die branch should be in master first, then in another branches too
#### *final commits in hotfix/we_gonna_die branch*
```bash
7de5cbf (HEAD -> hotfix/we_gonna_die) 1st commit to Hotfix
53aaf12 2nd commit to master
0f73a42 1st commit to master
```
#### *commit from hotfix/we_gonna_die branch should be in master (final commits in the branch)*
```bash
5af58c2 (HEAD -> master) 1st commit to Hotfix
a7bf9f2 (features/do_one) 1st commit to Features
7123dda (dev) 2nd commit to Dev
54a1302 1st commit to Dev
53aaf12 2nd commit to master
0f73a42 1st commit to master
```
#### *commit from hotfix/we_gonna_die branch in dev branch (final commits in the branch)*
```bash
68d564f (HEAD -> dev) 1st commit to Hotfix
7123dda 2nd commit to Dev
54a1302 1st commit to Dev
53aaf12 2nd commit to master
0f73a42 1st commit to master
```
#### *commit from hotfix/we_gonna_die branch in features/do_one branch (final commits in the branch)*
```bash
7b089a2 (HEAD -> features/do_one) 1st commit to Hotfix
a7bf9f2 1st commit to Features
7123dda 2nd commit to Dev
54a1302 1st commit to Dev
